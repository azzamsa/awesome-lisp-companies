## Virtual or Unsure of Location

- [Feetr.io](https://feetr.io/) "is entirely lisp".
  - Feetr is "an algorithm which understands momentum in the stock market, and finds where that momentum is flowing to find stocks with a good chance of really high gains. It averaged 9.17% daily increase across 127 stocks last month ([tweet](https://twitter.com/feetr_io/status/1587182923911991303))".
  - "Common Lisp was a conscious decision because it allows a small team to be incredibly productive, plus the fact that it's a live image allows you to connect to it over the internet and poke and prod the current state, which has really allowed a much clearer understanding of the data."
  - Soure: [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33467269), 2022. They post SLY screenshots on their Twitter^^ https://twitter.com/0xsmcn/status/1598665401633759233/photo/1
- [GeneNetwork](https://github.com/genenetwork/) uses [GNU Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/) and scheme extensively in production.
- the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) organization uses Common Lisp in at least two products:
  - [pgloader](http://pgloader.io/) (see [why it was rewritten from Python](https://tapoueh.org/blog/2014/05/why-is-pgloader-so-much-faster/)), and
  - [pgcharts](https://github.com/dimitri/pgcharts).
- [Pandora Bots](https://home.pandorabots.com/home.html) - Chatbots with Character.
  - "Easily bring your chatbots to life with real-time animation integrations."
  - "many of [PandoraBots] strengths come from the power and straightforwardness of AIML and a Lisp-based parsing and translatingi engine". Seen on https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9740557 interview of Fritz Kunze, founder of Franz, Inc.
